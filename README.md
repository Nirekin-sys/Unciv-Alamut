* Uniques
  * Tiger of God [Mongol Terror]
  >The Alamut Order of Assasins of the Nizari Ismaili utilized subliminal tactics and discreet warfare to grow their power and influence during their stay in the Middle East, taking cities when no power is overseering, and establishing fortresses when everyone is perceptive. Fueling and becoming a major player in the Middle East's politics.
  
  * Hashashin [Replaces Longswordsman]
  >The Hashashin is a master of subtlety and stealth. They engage in a matter of unconventional warfare, and are tasked with assassinating targets by the order of the Lords in Alamut, Masyaf or Lambsar castles; no matter the prestige, might or affiliation of the target.
  
  * Ismaili Castle [Replaces Castle]
  The Alamut established and constructed castles and fortresses of various numbers around their territories during the Middle Ages. Overlooking the territories that they handled, they are built robustly, adapted to their terrain, and were the most impregnable fortifications of their time until the advent of the Mongols.
